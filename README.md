### boxclock

High intensity interval training workout clock

## Parts
- Raspberry Pi 
- Monitor (optional: HDMI-CEC support with remote)
- Buttons (Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White)

## Dependencies
- Go (https://golang.org/project/)
- go-rpio (https://github.com/stianeikeland/go-rpio)

- high data-ink ratio (https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Data-Ink_Ratio)
- large readable typography
- white button for allstart,allstop
- colors for individual rep counting and stops

## Core functionality
- Wallclock
- Stopwatch (reset/start/multi-user-stop/timecap)
- Countdown timer (set/reset/start/end)

- Rep Counter (optional:rep target/each button has its own timer)

## Feature composition
- For time (stopwatch + timecap)
- For reps (wallclock + rep counter)
- AMRAP (Countdown timer: set=timecap, + rep counter)
- EMOM (Intervals: 1m-work,0m rest,n cycles)
- Tabata (Intervals: 20s-work,10sec rest,8 cycles)
